# Growth hacking sanity checklist

The main purpose of this checklist is to enable a more transparent and trust-inspiring approach to growth hacking, focusing on speed of execution and limiting dirsturbances of in-cycle work efforts.

This list is not meant to exhaustive â€“ if you can tick off most of the items, you should be in the clear ðŸš€

__Note:__ this is an evolving process, which will be refined as-we-go.


## 1. Define and scope

- [ ] The core problem we are trying to solve is clear to us.

- [ ] The main value proposition is clear to us.

- [ ] The absolute minimal requirements needed to solve the problem is clear to us â€“ __both design and code__.

- [ ] Metrics for measuring outcomes are clear to us.

- [ ] This MVP can be implemented in a short timeframe, and as a single deliverable.


## 2. Seek approval and communicate

- [ ] A designer has been introduced to, and accepts the MVP without raising any strong concerns.

> [!TIP]
> Thomas Angelbo Christensen is considered a designer.
>

- [ ] A developer has been introduced to, and accepts the MVP without raising any strong concerns.

> [!TIP]
> Jonas Bruun Jacobsen is considered a developer.

- [ ] __Optional:__ a product owner has been introduced to, and accepts the MVP without raising any strong concerns.

> [!NOTE]
> In most cases an MVP does not need attention from product before it has been proven successful.
>
> A feature might only be used to support a sale, in which case product owner involvement will not make sense.

> [!CAUTION]
> Reaching out to a product owner is mandatory if the MVP affects multiple customers or if the MVP would introduce significant changes to multiple users.

- [ ] Early feedback from above stakeholders has not affected the output of [1. define and scope](#1-define-and-scope)  â€“ __if it has, it must be re-visited__.

- [ ] We have considered if other departments need a heads up some point in the process.

  _(sales, CX, etc.)_

- [ ] We have a plan for ongoing feedback-loops and for communicating progress to relevant stakeholders.

- [ ] __Mandatory:__ points below have been communicated in the "growth-hacking" [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A7807720ebd1d478dbabc9082267da9b4%40thread.tacv2/growth-hacking?groupId=a7b6e749-52f6-425e-a702-1b2a691624fa&tenantId=1499dcc1-b83d-4414-9703-401eb796aee4).
  1. A brief description of the "why" and "how" â€“ if customer-centric; describe the customer need(s).
  2. A list of people involved with the MVP.


## 3. Tying up loose ends
- [ ] When the feature is launched, do still communicate it as a new feature in the Product Updates channel. 
      
- [ ] We have a plan for the future of this MVP

  _(will it go into product long-track after completion?, does it warrant further refinement?, etc.)_

- [ ] We have decided if this feature should go into production.

  _(is fidelity high enough?, will it be hidden behind a feature-flag?, etc.)_

- [ ] We have considered how we remove this feature if it fails to deliver any real value.

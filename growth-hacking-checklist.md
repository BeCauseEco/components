# Growth hacking sanity checklist

The main purpose of this checklist is to enable a more transparent approach to growth hacking, focusing on speed of execution and not disturbing in-cycle work efforts.

This list is not meant to exhaustive â€“ if you can tick off most of the items, you should be in the clear ðŸš€

_Note: this is a starting-point. This process will be refined as we learn more._


## 1. Define and scope

- [ ] The core problem we are trying to solve is clear to us.

- [ ] The main value proposition is clear to us.

- [ ] The absolute minimal requirements needed to solve the problem is clear to us â€“ __both design and code__.

- [ ] Metrics for measuring outcomes are clear to us.

- [ ] This MVP can be implemented in a short timeframe, and as a single deliverable.


## 2. Seek approval and communicate

- [ ] A designer has been introduced to, and accepts the MVP without raising any strong concerns.

> [!TIP]
> Thomas Angelbo Christensen is considered a designer.
>

- [ ] A developer has been introduced to, and accepts the MVP without raising any strong concerns.

> [!TIP]
> Jonas Bruun Jacobsen is considered a developer.

- [ ] __Optional__ a product owner has been introduced to, and accepts the MVP without raising any strong concerns.

> [!NOTE]
> In most cases an MVP does not need attention from product before it has been proven successful.
>
> A feature might only be used to support a sale, in which case product owner involvement will not make sense.

> [!CAUTION]
> Reaching out to a product owner is mandatory if the MVP affects multiple customers or if the MVP would introduce significant changes to multiple users.

- [ ] Early feedback from above stakeholders has not affected the output of [1. define and scope](#1-define-and-scope)  â€“ __if it has, it must be re-visited__.

- [ ] We have considered if other departments need a heads up some point in the process.

  _(sales, CX, etc.)_

- [ ] We have a plan for ongoing feedback-loops and for communicating progress to relevant stakeholders.


## 3. Tying up loose ends

- [ ] We have a plan for the future of this MVP

  _(will it go into product long-track after completion?, does it warrant further refinement?, etc.)_

- [ ] We have decided if this feature should go into production.

  _(is fidelity high enough?, will it be hidden behind a feature-flag?, etc.)_

- [ ] We have considered how we remove this feature if it fails to deliver any real value.
